## what is this repo
this is archive of scripts and documention of the topics i learnt in python 
- i made the documentation with my thougths and opinions (may take time)
- feel free to read my jouney of coding with python
- i make a some crazy spam codes instead of standard examples so give it a try before seeing code :)

Peace in our time :)
