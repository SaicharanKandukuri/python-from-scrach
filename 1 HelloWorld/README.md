# Hello World in python
Well Doing a world was easy. Comparing my journey with c to print something python is like print with less words and c takes more words

- there is no nead of header files 
- no need of main function
- no rule to end every keyword/cmd/function with `;`


Cause python is intelligent!

in python we print out text with an inbuilt function called `print` followed by `()`

The strcture looks like this for this instance

`print("<Text to print Out>")`

- so our Hello to the world looks like
```python
print ("Hello world")

```
# Running the code
To Run a python script file
- in cmd line

```bash
python -u hello_world.py
```

Pretty  Easy :)
